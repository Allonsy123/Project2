Determine type of fluid flow in a pipe using its Reynold's Number. 

Write a C++ program to determine and display the type of fluid flow (laminar, transition or turbulent) in a pipe using its Reynolds's number. Use a menu to choose the type of fluid (such as gasoline, fuel oil, lubricating oil, water etc). Choose inputs as pipe dimensions (diameter), velocity of the fluid and the kinematic viscosity of the fluid. You may also choose the viscosity as a temperature dependent variable.

Reynold's number (Re) = (average speed of fluid (V) x diameter of pipe (d)) / kinematic viscosity (theta)

For Flow use:
Re<2000 (laminar)
2000<=Re>=3000 (transition)
Re>3000 (turbulent)
